All sequences are indexed positionally (0 through length - 1) and all but strings can contain any type of object, including multiple types in the same sequence.

            "The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). (However, Van Rossum stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.). Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
            "Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\n",
            "Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible, though now-unsupported, Python 2.6 and 2.7.\n",
            "\n",
            "In February 1991, Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources. Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as \"one of Python's major programming units\". Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an else clause. In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that \"Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches\".\n",
            "The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia from where he released several versions.\n",
            "By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp's keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.\n",
            "During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic \"literacy\" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA. As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, outreach to non-programmers is not an active concern.\n",

CNRI requested that a version 1.6 be released, summarizing Python's development up to the point at which the development team left CNRI. Consequently, the release schedules for 1.6 and 2.0 had a significant amount of overlap. Python 2.0 was the only release from BeOpen.com. After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.\n",
            "The Python 1.6 release included a new CNRI license that was substantially longer than the CWI license that had been used for earlier releases.  The new license included a clause stating that the license was governed by the laws of the State of Virginia.  The Free Software Foundation argued that the choice-of-law clause was incompatible with the GNU General Public License.  BeOpen, CNRI and the FSF negotiated a change to Python's free software license that would make it GPL-compatible.

Python 2.0 also introduced a garbage collector able to collect reference cycles.\n",

All code, documentation and specifications added, from the time of Python 2.1's alpha release on, is owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a nonprofit organization formed in 2001, modeled after the Apache Software Foundation.

            "Python 3.0 (also called \"Python 3000\" or \"Py3K\") was released on December 3, 2008. It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language – the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number.  The guiding principle of Python 3 was: \"reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things\".\n",
            "Python 3.0 was developed with the same philosophy as in prior versions.  However, as Python had accumulated new and redundant ways to program the same task, Python 3.0 had an emphasis on removing duplicative constructs and modules, in keeping with the Zen of Python: \"There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\".\n",
            "Nonetheless, Python 3.0 remained a multi-paradigm language.

Python's dynamic typing combined with the plans to change the semantics of certain methods of dictionaries, for example, made perfect mechanical translation from Python 2.x to Python 3.0 very difficult. A tool called \"2to3\" does the parts of translation that can be done automatically.  At this, 2to3 appeared to be fairly successful, though an early review noted that there were aspects of translation that such a tool would never be able to handle. Prior to the roll-out of Python 3, projects requiring compatibility with both the 2.x and 3.x series were recommended to have one source (for the 2.x series), and produce releases for the Python 3.x platform using 2to3. Edits to the Python 3.x code were discouraged for so long as the code needed to run on Python 2.x.  This is no longer recommended; as of 2012 the preferred approach was to create a single code base that can run under both Python 2 and 3 using compatibility modules.\n",

            "Removal of the Python 2 input function, and the renaming of the raw_input function to input. Python 3's input function behaves like Python 2's raw_input function, in that the input is always returned as a string rather than being evaluated as an expression\n",
            "Moving reduce (but not map or filter) out of the built-in namespace and into functools (the rationale being code that uses reduce is less readable than code that uses a for loop and accumulator variable)\n",
            "Adding support for optional function annotations that can be used for informal type declarations or other purposes\n",

These IDEs are listed in alphabetic order of the supported language.\\n\\n', 'Python syntax and semantics': 'The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, and boasts a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.\\nPython\\'s syntax is simple and consistent, adhering to the principle that \"There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it.\" The language incorporates built-in data types and structures, control flow mechanisms,  first-class functions, and modules for better code reusability and organization. Python also uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation, contributing to its uncluttered visual layout.\\nThe language provides robust error handling through exceptions, and includes a debugger in the standard library for efficient problem-solving. Python\\'s syntax, designed for readability and ease of use, makes it a popular choice among beginners and professionals alike.\\n\\nPython was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra \"There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\", from the Zen of Python.\\nThis mantra is deliberately opposed to the Perl and Ruby mantra, \"there\\'s more than one way to do it\".\\n\\nPython has 35 keywords or reserved words; they cannot be used as identifiers.\\n\\nIn addition, Python also has 3 soft keywords. Unlike regular hard keywords, soft keywords are reserved words only in the limited contexts where interpreting them as keywords would make syntactic sense. These words can be used as identifiers elsewhere; You can define a function or variable named match or case.\\n\\n_\\ncase\\nmatch\\nNotes\\n\\nPython uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side rule). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block.\\nIn so-called \"free-format\" languages—that use the block structure derived from ALGOL—blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In most coding conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code.\\nA recursive function named foo, which is passed a single parameter, x, and if the parameter is 0 will call a different function named bar and otherwise will call baz, passing x, and also call itself recursively, passing x-1 as the parameter, could be implemented like this in Python:\\n\\nand could be written like this in C with K&R indent style:\\n\\nIncorrectly indented code could be misread by a human reader differently than it would be interpreted by a compiler or interpreter. For example, if the function call foo(x - 1) on the last line in the example above was erroneously indented to be outside the if/else block: \\n\\nit would cause the last line to always be executed, even when x is 0, resulting in an endless recursion.\\nWhile both space and tab characters are accepted as forms of indentation and any multiple of spaces can be used, spaces are recommended and 4 spaces (as in the above examples) are recommended and are by far the most commonly used. Mixing spaces and tabs on consecutive lines is not allowed starting with Python 3 because that can create bugs which are difficult to see, since many text editors do not visually distinguish spaces and tabs.\\n\\nSince Python is a dynamically-typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type information. All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions. Some people (including Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme \"call by object reference\". An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is an \"alias\", i.e. a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C/C++. The object\\'s value may be changed in the called function with the \"alias\", for example:\\n\\nFunction my_func changes the value of alist with the formal argument al, which is an alias of alist. However, any attempt to operate (assign a new object reference to) on the alias itself will have no effect on the original object. \\n\\nIn Python, non-innermost-local and not-declared-global accessible names are all aliases.\\nAmong dynamically-typed languages, Python is moderately type-checked. Implicit conversion is defined for numeric types (as well as booleans), so one may validly multiply a complex number by an integer (for instance) without explicit casting. However, there is no implicit conversion between, for example, numbers and strings; a string is an invalid argument to a mathematical function expecting a number.\\n\\nPython has a broad range of basic data types. Alongside conventional integer and floating-point arithmetic, it transparently supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic, complex numbers, and decimal numbers.\\nPython supports a wide variety of string operations. Strings in Python are immutable, so a string operation such as a substitution of characters, that in other programming languages might alter the string in place, returns a new string in Python. Performance considerations sometimes push for using special techniques in programs that modify strings intensively, such as joining character arrays into strings only as needed.\\n\\nOne of the very useful aspects of Python is the concept of collection (or container) types. In general a collection is an object that contains other objects in a way that is easily referenced or indexed. Collections come in two basic forms: sequences and mappings.\\nThe ordered sequential types are lists (dynamic arrays), tuples, and strings. All sequences are indexed positionally (0 through length - 1) and all but strings can contain any type of object, including multiple types in the same sequence. Both strings and tuples are immutable, making them perfect candidates for dictionary keys (see below). Lists, on the other hand, are mutable; elements can be inserted, deleted, modified, appended, or sorted in-place.\\nMappings, on the other hand, are (often unordered) types implemented in the form of dictionaries which \"map\" a set of immutable keys to corresponding elements (much like a mathematical function).  For example, one could define a dictionary having a string \"toast\" mapped to the integer 42 or vice versa. The keys in a dictionary must be of an immutable Python type, such as an integer or a string, because under the hood they are implemented via a hash function. This makes for much faster lookup times, but requires keys not change.\\nDictionaries are central to the internals of Python as they reside at the core of all objects and classes: the mappings between variable names (strings) and the values which the names reference are stored as dictionaries (see Object system). Since these dictionaries are directly accessible (via an object\\'s __dict__ attribute), metaprogramming is a straightforward and natural process in Python.\\nA set collection type is an unindexed, unordered collection that contains no duplicates, and implements set theoretic operations such as union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and subset testing. There are two types of sets: set and frozenset, the only difference being that set is mutable and frozenset is immutable. Elements in a set must be hashable. Thus, for example, a frozenset can be an element of a regular set whereas the opposite is not true.\\nPython also provides extensive collection manipulating abilities such as built in containment checking and a generic iteration protocol.\\n\\nIn Python, everything is an object, even classes. Classes, as objects, have a class, which is known as their metaclass. Python also supports multiple inheritance and mixins.\\nThe language supports extensive introspection of types and classes. Types can be read and compared—types are instances of type.  The attributes of an object can be extracted as a dictionary.\\nOperators can be overloaded in Python by defining special member functions—for instance, defining a method named __add__ on a class permits one to use the + operator on objects of that class.\\n\\nPython has various kinds of string literals.\\n\\nEither single or double quotes can be used to quote strings. Unlike in Unix shell languages, Perl or Perl-influenced languages such as Ruby or Groovy, single quotes and double quotes function identically, i.e. there is no string interpolation of $foo expressions. However, interpolation can be done in various ways: with \"f-strings\" (since Python 3.6), using the format method or the old % string-format operator.\\n\\nFor instance, all of these Python statements:are equivalent to the Perl statement:They build a string using the variables num and printer.\\n\\nThere are also multi-line strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotes and function like here documents in Perl and Ruby.\\nA simple example with variable interpolation (using the format method) is:\\n\\nFinally, all of the previously mentioned string types come in \"raw\" varieties (denoted by placing a literal r before the opening quote), which do no backslash-interpolation and hence are very useful for regular expressions; compare \"@-quoting\" in C#. Raw strings were originally included specifically for regular expressions. Due to limitations of the tokenizer, raw strings may not have a trailing backslash. Creating a raw string holding a Windows path ending with a backslash requires some variety of workaround (commonly, using forward slashes instead of backslashes, since Windows accepts both).\\nExamples include:\\n\\nString literals (using possibly different quote conventions) appearing contiguously and only separated by whitespace (including new lines), are allowed and are aggregated into a single longer string.\\nThus\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\nSince Python 3.0, the default character set is UTF-8 both for source code and the interpreter. In UTF-8, unicode strings are handled like traditional byte strings. This example will work:\\n\\nNumeric literals in Python are of the normal sort, e.g. 0, -1, 3.4, 3.5e-8.\\nPython has arbitrary-length integers and automatically increases their storage size as necessary. Prior to Python 3, there were two kinds of integral numbers: traditional fixed size integers and \"long\" integers of arbitrary size. The conversion to \"long\" integers was performed automatically when required, and thus the programmer usually didn\\'t have to be aware of the two integral types. In newer language versions the distinction is completely gone and all integers behave like arbitrary-length integers.\\nPython supports normal floating point numbers, which are created when a dot is used in a literal (e.g. 1.1), when an integer and a floating point number are used in an expression, or as a result of some mathematical operations (\"true division\" via the / operator, or exponentiation with a negative exponent).\\nPython also supports complex numbers natively.  Complex numbers are indicated with the J or j suffix, e.g. 3 + 4j.\\n\\nPython has syntactic support for the creation of container types.\\nLists (class list) are mutable sequences of items of arbitrary types, and can be created either with the special syntax\\n\\nor using normal object creation\\n\\nTuples (class tuple) are immutable sequences of items of arbitrary types. There is also a special syntax to create tuples\\n\\nAlthough tuples are created by separating items with commas, the whole construct is usually wrapped in parentheses to increase readability. An empty tuple is denoted by (), while a tuple with a single value can be created with (1,).\\nSets (class set) are mutable containers of hashable items of arbitrary types, with no duplicates. The items are not ordered, but sets support iteration over the items. The syntax for set creation uses curly brackets\\n\\nPython sets are very much like mathematical sets, and support operations like set intersection and union. Python also features a frozenset class for immutable sets, see Collection types.\\nDictionaries (class dict) are mutable mappings tying keys and corresponding values. Python has special syntax to create dictionaries ({key: value})\\n\\nThe dictionary syntax is similar to the set syntax, the difference is the presence of colons. The empty literal {} results in an empty dictionary rather than an empty set, which is instead created using the non-literal constructor: set().\\n\\nPython includes the +, -, *, / (\"true division\"), // (floor division), % (modulus), and ** (exponentiation) operators, with their usual mathematical precedence.\\nIn Python 3, x / y performs \"true division\", meaning that it always returns a float, even if both x and y are integers that divide evenly.\\n\\nand // performs integer division or floor division, returning the floor of the quotient as an integer.\\nIn Python 2 (and most other programming languages), unless explicitly requested, x / y performed integer division, returning a float only if either input was a float. However, because Python is a dynamically-typed language, it was not always possible to tell which operation was being performed, which often led to subtle bugs, thus prompting the introduction of the // operator and the change in semantics of the / operator in Python 3.\\n\\nThe comparison operators, i.e. ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, is, is not, in and not in are used on all manner of values. Numbers, strings, sequences, and mappings can all be compared. In Python 3, disparate types (such as a str and an int) do not have a consistent relative ordering, and attempts to compare these types raises a TypeError exception. While it was possible to compare disparate types in Python 2 (for example, whether a string was greater-than or less-than an integer), the ordering was undefined; this was considered a historical design quirk and was ultimately removed in Python 3.\\nChained comparison expressions such as a < b < c have roughly the meaning that they have in mathematics, rather than the unusual meaning found in C and similar languages. The terms are evaluated and compared in order. The operation has short-circuit semantics, meaning that evaluation is guaranteed to stop as soon as a verdict is clear: if a < b is false, c is never evaluated as the expression cannot possibly be true anymore.\\nFor expressions without side effects, a < b < c is equivalent to a < b and b < c. However, there is a substantial difference when the expressions have side effects. a < f(x) < b will evaluate f(x) exactly once, whereas a < f(x) and f(x) < b will evaluate it twice if the value of a is less than f(x) and once otherwise.\\n\\nIn all versions of Python, boolean operators treat zero values or empty values such as \"\", 0, None, 0.0, [], and {} as false, while in general treating non-empty, non-zero values as true. The boolean values True and False were added to the language in Python 2.2.1 as constants (subclassed from 1 and 0) and were changed to be full blown keywords in Python 3. The binary comparison operators such as == and > return either True or False.\\nThe boolean operators and and or use minimal evaluation. For example, y == 0 or x/y > 100 will never raise a divide-by-zero exception. These operators return the value of the last operand evaluated, rather than True or False. Thus the expression (4 and 5) evaluates to 5, and (4 or 5) evaluates to 4.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, another strength of Python is the availability of a functional programming style. As may be expected, this makes working with lists and other collections much more straightforward.\\n\\nOne such construction is the list comprehension, which can be expressed with the following format:\\n\\nUsing list comprehension to calculate the first five powers of two:\\n\\nThe Quicksort algorithm can be expressed elegantly (albeit inefficiently) using list comprehensions:\\n\\nPython 2.7+ also supports set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.\\n\\nIn Python, functions are first-class objects that can be created and passed around dynamically.\\nPython\\'s limited support for anonymous functions is the lambda construct. An example is the anonymous function which squares its input, called with the argument of 5:\\n\\nLambdas are limited to containing an expression rather than statements, although control flow can still be implemented less elegantly within lambda by using short-circuiting, and more idiomatically with conditional expressions.\\n\\nPython has had support for lexical closures since version 2.2. Here\\'s an example function that returns a function that approximates the derivative of the given function:\\n\\nPython\\'s syntax, though, sometimes leads programmers of other languages to think that closures are not supported. Variable scope in Python is implicitly determined by the scope in which one assigns a value to the variable, unless scope is explicitly declared with global or nonlocal.\\nNote that the closure\\'s binding of a name to some value is not mutable from within the function. Given:\\n\\nand you can see that b, as visible from the closure\\'s scope, retains the value it had; the changed binding of b inside the inner function did not propagate out.  The way around this is to use a nonlocal b statement in bar. In Python 2 (which lacks nonlocal), the usual workaround is to use a mutable value and change that value, not the binding.  E.g., a list with one element.\\n\\nIntroduced in Python 2.2 as an optional feature and finalized in version 2.3, generators are Python\\'s mechanism for lazy evaluation of a function that would otherwise return a space-prohibitive or computationally intensive list.\\nThis is an example to lazily generate the prime numbers:\\n\\nWhen calling this function, the returned value can be iterated over much like a list:\\n\\nThe definition of a generator appears identical to that of a function, except the keyword yield is used in place of return. However, a generator is an object with persistent state, which can repeatedly enter and leave the same scope. A generator call can then be used in place of a list, or other structure whose elements will be iterated over. Whenever the for loop in the example requires the next item, the generator is called, and yields the next item.\\nGenerators don\\'t have to be infinite like the prime-number example above. When a generator terminates, an internal exception is raised which indicates to any calling context that there are no more values. A for loop or other iteration will then terminate.\\n\\nIntroduced in Python 2.4, generator expressions are the lazy evaluation equivalent of list comprehensions.  Using the prime number generator provided in the above section, we might define a lazy, but not quite infinite collection.\\n\\nMost of the memory and time needed to generate this many primes will not be used until the needed element is actually accessed.  Unfortunately, you cannot perform simple indexing and slicing of generators, but must use the itertools module or \"roll your own\" loops.  In contrast, a list comprehension is functionally equivalent, but is greedy in performing all the work:\\n\\nThe list comprehension will immediately create a large list (with 78498 items, in the example, but transiently creating a list of primes under two million), even if most elements are never accessed.  The generator comprehension is more parsimonious.\\n\\nWhile lists and generators had comprehensions/expressions, in Python versions older than 2.7 the other Python built-in collection types (dicts and sets) had to be kludged in using lists or generators:\\n\\nPython 2.7 and 3.0 unified all collection types by introducing dictionary and set comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions:\\n\\nPython supports most object oriented programming (OOP) techniques. It allows polymorphism, not only within a class hierarchy but also by duck typing. Any object can be used for any type, and it will work so long as it has the proper methods and attributes. And everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, numbers and modules. Python also has support for metaclasses, an advanced tool for enhancing classes\\' functionality. Naturally, inheritance, including multiple inheritance, is supported. Python has very limited support for private variables using name mangling which is rarely used in practice as information hiding is seen by some as unpythonic, in that it suggests that the class in question contains unaesthetic or ill-planned internals. The slogan \"we\\'re all responsible users here\" is used to describe this attitude.\\n\\nAs is true for modules, classes in Python do not put an absolute barrier between definition and user, but rather rely on the politeness of the user not to \"break into the definition.\"\\nOOP doctrines such as the use of accessor methods to read data members are not enforced in Python. Just as Python offers functional-programming constructs but does not attempt to demand referential transparency, it offers an object system but does not demand OOP behavior. Moreover, it is always possible to redefine the class using properties (see Properties) so that when a certain variable is set or retrieved in calling code, it really invokes a function call, so that spam.eggs = toast might really invoke spam.set_eggs(toast). This nullifies the practical advantage of accessor functions, and it remains OOP because the property eggs becomes a legitimate part of the object\\'s interface: it need not reflect an implementation detail.\\nIn version 2.2 of Python, \"new-style\" classes were introduced. With new-style classes, objects and types were unified, allowing the subclassing of types.\\nEven entirely new types can be defined, complete with custom behavior for infix operators. This allows for many radical things to be done syntactically within Python. A new method resolution order for multiple inheritance was also adopted with Python 2.3.  It is also possible to run custom code while accessing or setting attributes, though the details of those techniques have evolved between Python versions.\\n\\nThe with statement handles resources, and allows users to work with the Context Manager protocol. One function (__enter__()) is called when entering scope and another (__exit__()) when leaving. This prevents forgetting to free the resource and also handles more complicated situations such as freeing the resource when an exception occurs while it is in use. Context Managers are often used with files, database connections, test cases, etc.\\n\\nProperties allow specially defined methods to be invoked on an object instance by using the same syntax as used for attribute access.  An example of a class defining some properties is:\\n\\nA class that defines one or more of the three special methods __get__(self, instance, owner), __set__(self, instance, value), __delete__(self, instance) can be used as a descriptor. Creating an instance of a descriptor as a class member of a second class makes the instance a property of the second class.\\n\\nPython allows the creation of class methods and static methods via the use of the @classmethod  and @staticmethod decorators.  The first argument to a class method is the class object instead of the self-reference to the instance.  A static method has no special first argument.  Neither the instance, nor the class object is passed to a static method.\\n\\nPython supports (and extensively uses) exception handling as a means of testing for error conditions and other \"exceptional\" events in a program.\\nPython style calls for the use of exceptions whenever an error condition might arise. Rather than testing for access to a file or resource before actually using it, it is conventional in Python to just go ahead and try to use it, catching the exception if access is rejected.\\nExceptions can also be used as a more general means of non-local transfer of control, even when an error is not at issue. For instance, the Mailman mailing list software, written in Python, uses exceptions to jump out of deeply nested message-handling logic when a decision has been made to reject a message or hold it for moderator approval.\\nExceptions are often used as an alternative to the if-block, especially in threaded situations. A commonly invoked motto is EAFP, or \"It is Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission,\" which is attributed to Grace Hopper. The alternative, known as LBYL, or \"Look Before You Leap\", explicitly tests for pre-conditions.\\nIn this first code sample, following the LBYL approach, there is an explicit check for the attribute before access:\\n\\nThis second sample follows the EAFP paradigm:\\n\\nThese two code samples have the same effect, although there will be performance differences.  When spam has the attribute eggs, the EAFP sample will run faster.  When spam does not have the attribute eggs (the \"exceptional\" case), the EAFP sample will run slower. The Python profiler can be used in specific cases to determine performance characteristics. If exceptional cases are rare, then the EAFP version will have superior average performance than the alternative. In addition, it avoids the whole class of time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) vulnerabilities, other race conditions, and is compatible with duck typing. A drawback of EAFP is that it can be used only with statements; an exception cannot be caught in a generator expression, list comprehension, or lambda function.\\n\\nPython has two ways to annotate Python code. One is by using comments to indicate what some part of the code does. Single-line comments begin with the hash character (#) and continue until the end of the line. Comments spanning more than one line are achieved by inserting a multi-line string (with \"\"\" or \\'\\'\\' as the delimiter on each end) that is not used in assignment or otherwise evaluated, but sits in between other statements.\\nCommenting a piece of code:\\n\\nCommenting a piece of code with multiple lines:\\n\\nDocstrings (documentation strings), that is, strings that are located alone without assignment as the first indented line within a module, class, method or function, automatically set their contents as an attribute named __doc__, which is intended to store a human-readable description of the object\\'s purpose, behavior, and usage. The built-in help function generates its output based on __doc__ attributes. Such strings can be delimited with \" or \\' for single line strings, or may span multiple lines if delimited with either \"\"\" or \\'\\'\\' which is Python\\'s notation for specifying multi-line strings. However, the style guide for the language specifies that triple double quotes (\"\"\") are preferred for both single and multi-line docstrings.\\nSingle-line docstring:\\n\\nMulti-line docstring:\\n\\nDocstrings can be as large as the programmer wants and contain line breaks. In contrast with comments, docstrings are themselves Python objects and are part of the interpreted code that Python runs. That means that a running program can retrieve its own docstrings and manipulate that information, but the normal usage is to give other programmers information about how to invoke the object being documented in the docstring.\\nThere are tools available that can extract the docstrings from Python code and generate documentation. Docstring documentation can also be accessed from the interpreter with the help() function, or from the shell with the pydoc command pydoc.\\nThe doctest standard module uses interactions copied from Python shell sessions into docstrings to create tests, whereas the docopt module uses them to define command-line options.\\n\\nFunction annotations (type hints) are defined in PEP 3107. They allow attaching data to the arguments and return of a function. The behaviour of annotations is not defined by the language, and is left to third party frameworks. For example, a library could be written to handle static typing:\\n\\nA decorator is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function, method or class definition.  A decorator is passed the original object being defined and returns a modified object, which is then bound to the name in the definition.  Python decorators were inspired in part by Java annotations, and have a similar syntax; the decorator syntax is pure syntactic sugar, using @ as the keyword:\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\nDecorators are a form of metaprogramming; they enhance the action of the function or method they decorate. For example, in the sample below, viking_chorus might cause menu_item to be run 8 times (see Spam sketch) for each time it is called:\\n\\nCanonical uses of function decorators are for creating class methods or static methods, adding function attributes, tracing, setting pre- and postconditions, and synchronization, but can be used for far more, including tail recursion elimination, memoization and even improving the writing of other decorators.\\nDecorators can be chained by placing several on adjacent lines:\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\nor, using intermediate variables\\n\\nIn the example above, the favourite_colour decorator factory takes an argument. Decorator factories must return a decorator, which is then called with the object to be decorated as its argument:\\n\\nThis would then decorate the black_knight function such that the colour, \"Blue\", would be printed prior to the black_knight function running. Closure ensures that the colour argument is accessible to the innermost wrapper function even when it is returned and goes out of scope, which is what allows decorators to work.\\nDespite the name, Python decorators are not an implementation of the decorator pattern. The decorator pattern is a design pattern used in statically-typed object-oriented programming languages to allow functionality to be added to objects at run time; Python decorators add functionality to functions and methods at definition time, and thus are a higher-level construct than decorator-pattern classes. The decorator pattern itself is trivially implementable in Python, because the language is duck typed, and so is not usually considered as such.\\n\\nUsers of curly bracket languages, such as C or Java, sometimes expect or wish Python to follow a block-delimiter convention. Brace-delimited block syntax has been repeatedly requested, and consistently rejected by core developers. The Python interpreter contains an easter egg that summarizes its developers\\' feelings on this issue. The code from __future__ import braces raises the exception SyntaxError: not a chance. The __future__ module is normally used to provide features from future versions of Python.\\nAnother hidden message, the Zen of Python (a summary of Python design philosophy), is displayed when trying to import this.\\nThe message Hello world! is printed when the import statement import __hello__ is used. In Python 2.7, instead of Hello world! it prints Hello world....\\nImporting the antigravity module opens a web browser to xkcd comic 353 that portrays a humorous fictional use for such a module, intended to demonstrate the ease with which Python modules enable additional functionality. In Python 3, this module also contains an implementation of the \"geohash\" algorithm, a reference to xkcd comic 426.\\n\\n\"The Python Language Reference\".\\nVan Rossum, Guido. \"The Python Tutorial\". (written by the author of Python)\\nRamalho, Luciano (April 2022). Fluent Python, 2nd Edition. O\\'Reilly Media, Inc. ISBN 9781492056355.', 'Zen of Python': 'The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 \"guiding principles\" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Python code that aligns with these principles is often referred to as \"Pythonic\".\\nSoftware engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters\\' list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.\\nPeters\\' Zen of Python was included as entry number 20 in the language\\'s official Python Enhancement Proposals and was released into the public domain. It is also included as an Easter egg in the Python interpreter, where it can be displayed by entering import this.\\nIn May 2020, Barry Warsaw (developer of GNU Mailman) wrote the lyrics to music.', 'History of Python': 'The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python\\'s principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). (However, Van Rossum stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.). Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus.\\nPython 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\\nPython 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible, though now-unsupported, Python 2.6 and 2.7.\\n\\nIn February 1991, Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources. Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as \"one of Python\\'s major programming units\". Python\\'s exception model also resembles Modula-3\\'s, with the addition of an else clause. In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python\\'s userbase.\\n\\nPython reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that \"Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches\".\\nThe last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia from where he released several versions.\\nBy version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp\\'s keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.\\nDuring Van Rossum\\'s stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic \"literacy\" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E\\'s goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA. As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, outreach to non-programmers is not an active concern.\\n\\nIn 2000, the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. CNRI requested that a version 1.6 be released, summarizing Python\\'s development up to the point at which the development team left CNRI. Consequently, the release schedules for 1.6 and 2.0 had a significant amount of overlap. Python 2.0 was the only release from BeOpen.com. After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.\\nThe Python 1.6 release included a new CNRI license that was substantially longer than the CWI license that had been used for earlier releases.  The new license included a clause stating that the license was governed by the laws of the State of Virginia.  The Free Software Foundation argued that the choice-of-law clause was incompatible with the GNU General Public License.  BeOpen, CNRI and the FSF negotiated a change to Python\\'s free software license that would make it GPL-compatible.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6, with a few minor bug fixes, and with the new GPL-compatible license.\\n\\nPython 2.0, released October 2000, introduced list comprehensions, a feature borrowed from the functional programming languages SETL and Haskell. Python\\'s syntax for this construct is very similar to Haskell\\'s, apart from Haskell\\'s preference for punctuation characters and Python\\'s preference for alphabetic keywords. Python 2.0 also introduced a garbage collector able to collect reference cycles.\\nPython 2.1 was close to Python 1.6.1, as well as Python 2.0. Its license was renamed Python Software Foundation License. All code, documentation and specifications added, from the time of Python 2.1\\'s alpha release on, is owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a nonprofit organization formed in 2001, modeled after the Apache Software Foundation. The release included a change to the language specification to support nested scopes, like other statically scoped languages. (The feature was turned off by default, and not required, until Python 2.2.)\\nPython 2.2 was released in December 2001; a major innovation was the unification of Python\\'s types (types written in C) and classes (types written in Python) into one hierarchy. This single unification made Python\\'s object model purely and consistently object oriented. Also added were generators which were inspired by Icon.\\n\\nPython 2.5 was released in September 2006 and introduced the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom.\\nPython 2.6 was released to coincide with Python 3.0, and included some features from that release, as well as a \"warnings\" mode that highlighted the use of features that were removed in Python 3.0. Similarly, Python 2.7 coincided with and included features from Python 3.1, which was released on June 26, 2009.\\nParallel 2.x and 3.x releases then ceased, and Python 2.7 was the last release in the 2.x series. In November 2014, it was announced that Python 2.7 would be supported until 2020, but users were encouraged to move to Python 3 as soon as possible. Python 2.7 support ended on January 1, 2020, along with code freeze of 2.7 development branch. A final release, 2.7.18, occurred on April 20, 2020, and included fixes for critical bugs and release blockers. This marked the end-of-life of Python 2.\\n\\nPython 3.0 (also called \"Python 3000\" or \"Py3K\") was released on December 3, 2008. It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language – the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number.  The guiding principle of Python 3 was: \"reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things\".\\nPython 3.0 was developed with the same philosophy as in prior versions.  However, as Python had accumulated new and redundant ways to program the same task, Python 3.0 had an emphasis on removing duplicative constructs and modules, in keeping with the Zen of Python: \"There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\".\\nNonetheless, Python 3.0 remained a multi-paradigm language.  Coders could still follow object-oriented, structured, and functional programming paradigms, among others, but within such broad choices, the details were intended to be more obvious in Python 3.0 than they were in Python 2.x.\\n\\nPython 3.0 broke backward compatibility, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python\\'s dynamic typing combined with the plans to change the semantics of certain methods of dictionaries, for example, made perfect mechanical translation from Python 2.x to Python 3.0 very difficult. A tool called \"2to3\" does the parts of translation that can be done automatically.  At this, 2to3 appeared to be fairly successful, though an early review noted that there were aspects of translation that such a tool would never be able to handle. Prior to the roll-out of Python 3, projects requiring compatibility with both the 2.x and 3.x series were recommended to have one source (for the 2.x series), and produce releases for the Python 3.x platform using 2to3. Edits to the Python 3.x code were discouraged for so long as the code needed to run on Python 2.x.  This is no longer recommended; as of 2012 the preferred approach was to create a single code base that can run under both Python 2 and 3 using compatibility modules.\\n\\nSome of the major changes included for Python 3.0 were:\\n\\nChanging print so that it is a built-in function, not a statement.  This made it easier to change a module to use a different print function, as well as making the syntax more regular.  In Python 2.6 and 2.7 print() is available as a builtin but is masked by the print statement syntax, which can be disabled by entering from __future__ import print_function at the top of the file\\nRemoval of the Python 2 input function, and the renaming of the raw_input function to input. Python 3\\'s input function behaves like Python 2\\'s raw_input function, in that the input is always returned as a string rather than being evaluated as an expression\\nMoving reduce (but not map or filter) out of the built-in namespace and into functools (the rationale being code that uses reduce is less readable than code that uses a for loop and accumulator variable)\\nAdding support for optional function annotations that can be used for informal type declarations or other purposes\\nUnifying the str/unicode types, representing text, and introducing a separate immutable bytes type; and a mostly corresponding mutable bytearray type, both of which represent arrays of bytes\\nRemoving backward-compatibility features, including old-style classes, string exceptions, and implicit relative imports\\nA change in integer division functionality: in Python 2, integer division always returns an integer. For example 5 / 2 is 2; whereas in Python 3, 5 / 2 is 2.5. (In both Python 2 – 2.2 onwards – and Python 3, a separate operator exists to provide the old behavior: 5 // 2 is 2)\\nAllowing non-ASCII letters to be used in identifiers, such as in smörgåsbord, fully supporting Unicode characters in source code (UTF-8 is used by default)\\nSubsequent releases in the Python 3.x series have included additional, substantial new features; all ongoing development of the language is done in the 3.x series.\\n\\nReleases before numbered versions:\\n\\nImplementation started – December, 1989\\nInternal releases at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica – 1990\\n\\nTable notes:\\n\\nHistory of software engineering\\n\\nGuido Van Rossum blog on Python\\'s History', 'Ball python': 'The ball python (Python regius), also called the royal python, is a python species native to West and Central Africa, where it lives in grasslands, shrublands and open forests.
